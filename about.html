                    Founded in 2025, our Technical College Club is a vibrant community of innovators, learners, and
                    problem-solvers. Though young in years, we are bold in vision—bringing together students from
                    diverse
                    domains of technology to collaborate, create, and grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that knowledge thrives when shared. That’s why our club spans multiple domains, from
                    embedded
                    systems and programming to AI, design, and beyond. Each domain is a hub of exploration, where
                    members
                    can dive deep into their interests while contributing to a larger culture of interdisciplinary
                    learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is simple yet powerful:<br>
                    - Empower students with hands-on experiences and real-world projects.<br>
                    - Encourage collaboration across different technical fields.<br>
                    - Foster innovation by turning ideas into impactful solutions.<br>
                    - Build community where curiosity, creativity, and teamwork flourish.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a club that started this year, we are just at the beginning of our journey. Every workshop,
                    project,
                    and discussion is a step toward shaping not only skilled professionals but also responsible
                    innovators
                    who will lead the future of technology.
                    Together, we are more than a club—we are a launchpad for ideas, a support system for growth, and a
                    family of passionate technologists ready to make a difference.
